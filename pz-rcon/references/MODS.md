# Recommended Mods for B42 Multiplayer

To maximize the "AI Director" experience with `pz-rcon`, we recommend the following Build 42 compatible mods.

## 🚗 Vehicles (for Rewards)
Use these with `addvehicle "Script" "Player"`.

**Autotsar Tuning Atelier - B42 Versions**
*   **Bus**: `Autotsar.Bus` (Verify exact script ID in mod files)
*   **Jaap Wrungel**: `Autotsar.JaapWrungel`
*   **Petyarbuilt 379**: `Autotsar.Peterbilt`

**Military & Utility**
*   **'67 Cadillac Gage Commando**: Perfect for "military support" drops.
*   **'97 ADI Bushmaster**: High-tier reward for server events.
*   **'86 Chevrolet CUCV**: Standard military utility.

*Tip: To find exact vehicle script names, look in the mod's `media/scripts/vehicles` folder or check the Workshop page description.*

## 🎵 Atmosphere
*   **True Music B42**: Essential.
    *   **Reward Idea**: Airdrop a boombox and rare cassettes.
    *   **Command**: `additem "Player" "TrueMusic.Cassette_Artist_Song"` (IDs depend on music packs).

## 🗺️ Maps (for Event Locations)
Use these locations in your narrative broadcasts ("Horde reported in Grapeseed...").
*   **Raven Creek B42**: High density, perfect for "suicide mission" rewards.
*   **Grapeseed [B42 Unstable Remake]**
*   **Camden County B42**

## 🛠️ Admin Tools
*   **Legion Zomboid Server/Admin Tools [B42]**
    *   Adds commands like `/lootspawn` (respawn loot in current building).
    *   Useful for "restocking" a dungeon/event location before players arrive.

## ⚠️ Notes
*   **Expanded Helicopter Events**: Currently in production for B42 (as of late 2025). Until released, use the built-in `chopper` command.
*   **Horde Night**: You don't need a mod! Use the included `scripts/horde_night.sh` to trigger dynamic horde nights via RCON.
